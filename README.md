# 📈 Quant Trading Prediction Model 📉

Welcome to the **Quantitative Trading Prediction Model** repository! This project combines **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and a **short Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for trading action predictions. 🌟 We use both financial data and **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** data to bring sustainability into trading. 💹

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our model leverages:

- 📊 **Technical Indicators** from historical trading data.
- 🖼️ **Chart Analysis** to identify patterns and trends.
- 🌍 **ESG Metrics** for sustainable investment insights.

With ESG scores, we take a socially-conscious approach that adds depth to traditional quantitative trading models. 🌱

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Data Preprocessing
- **PCA**: Reduces high-dimensional data for faster, more efficient predictions.
- **ESG Data**: Uses MSCI ESG Data API to blend sustainability insights with trading data.

### 🧠 Model Structure
- **Dual-input ANN** architecture with dense layers, batch normalization, and dropout.
- Optimized for **binary action predictions** (e.g., buy/sell) based on market conditions.

---

## 📊 Evaluation
- Tracks **accuracy** and **AUC** (Area Under Curve) during training/testing.
- Includes **visualization tools** for tracking accuracy and loss, providing insights into model performance.
